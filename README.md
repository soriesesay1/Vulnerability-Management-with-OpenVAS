# Vulnerability-Management-with-OpenVAS
My beginner practical Vulnerability-Management-with-OpenVAS using Azure.

Before we jump into the practical side of Vulnerabulity Management we need to know what is Vulnerabulity Management and it steps?

**What is Vulnerability Management? **


Answer: - It is a weakness in any system. It is a crucial aspect of cybersecurity aimed at identifying, evaluating, and mitigating security vulnerabilities within a computer system, network, or application. The goal is to proactively address potential weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious actors.


**Steps for Vulnerability Management:**

•	***Identification:*** - Discovering and cataloging potential vulnerabilities in a system, including software, hardware, and configuration issues.

•	**Assessment:** - Evaluating the vulnerabilities to determine their severity and potential impact on the security of the system.

•	**Prioritization:** - Ranking vulnerabilities based on their level of risk and criticality, considering factors such as the ease of exploitation and potential consequences.

•	**Mitigation:** - Implementing measures to reduce or eliminate the identified vulnerabilities. This may involve applying patches, reconfiguring systems, or implementing security controls.

•	**Monitoring:** - Continuously monitoring the system for new vulnerabilities and applying updates or patches as needed. Regular assessments help maintain a secure posture over time.


What is Azure?

**Answer:** - Microsoft Azure is a public cloud computing platform run by Microsoft that offers access, management, and the development of applications and services through global data centers. It provides a range of capabilities, including software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

Start by going **azure.microsoft.com** to create a new account if you don't have any.

•	When you create the free azure account on **azure.microsoft.com**, you will get a credit of $200 dollars to use and click start free.

**Reason:** - We don’t need too much because we are just practicing.

**Configuration:** - Under Basics, your tables will look like this below. 

 •	For Resource group, we create new one and mine is D-Vulnet.
 
 •	For Virtual machine, you can choose any name and mine is OpenVas-Vul.
 
 •	Region: - Because I am in the US, I will choose (US) East US 2 and you can choose anything for your location.
 
 •	Image: you can leave it as default. 
 
 •	VM architecture as default.
 
 •	Size, you can change it as to whatever that suits your region.
 
 •	Authentication Type, choose password so it can give you a prompt for username & password.
 
 •	Leave everything on default for Disks, Networking, and Management.
 
 •	For Monitoring, under Diagnostics select Disable and click Review + Create and make sure it says Validation passed. 
 
 •	You will have a page like this which shows deployment is complete.
 
 •	Type virtual machine on the search bar to see the OpenVas server machine we created. 
 
 •	Open Powershell on your windows machine or terminal on Mac so we can ssh over public internet. 
 
 •	We copy our VM public IP address to ssh into it. 
 
 •	To ssh into our VM using powershell, we type in this command ssh username@public ip address like this ssh azureuser@20.85.120.233 and press enter.  
 
 •	After that powershell will ask you if you want to continue and type in yes like this. 
 
 •	Remember, the username and password we created during our VM creation is the same you will use to login to powershell.
 
 •	If your login is successful, you will have a screen that shows the creators of openvas ‘HOSSTED’ and if you don’t see that name, it shows that you did not configure your VM very well. 
 
 •	The default login and password for OpenVas on powershell, username: - admin & pw: - afd7623c-6955-41ae-a921-3b85e3502272
 
 •	We copy the ip address from openvas and paste it to a new tab on our browser. https://20.85.120.233.c.hossted.com
